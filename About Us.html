  <h2>Overview of <em><strong>Tea Charge</strong></em></h2>
  <hr size="5" noshade><br>
  <p>Not too long ago, four friends met in a city for
    a cup of tea. Although they found the taste
    ordinary, the ambience of the shop did not
    please them. They explored the city in pursuit
    of the best quality tea shop, but much to their
    disappointment, they couldn’t find any. They
    studied the needs of the local tea consumers
    and decided to craft the perfect venue that
    offered the finest quality of tea with a
    pleasant ambience and the top notch service
    to the customers. This thought birthed the
    idea of “Tea Charge”- an enlivening space to
    recharge your soul.</p><br />

  <h2>What do we serve at Tea Charge?</h2>
  <p>At <strong>Tea Charge</strong>, our customers
    experience a unique taste which
    our chefs developed and
    mastered over the years. Our tea
    powder is the perfect blend of
    tea leaves and tea dust
    garnished with a pinch of our
    love. Our USP is the method of
    preparation which gives the
    perfect taste to fulfil the
    customer’s palette without
    burning their <em>“pocket”</em>.</p><br />
