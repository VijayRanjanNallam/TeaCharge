  <h2><strong>Tea charge</strong><br>Franchise Cost</h2>
  <p>We are a budding company in the tea
    and health community. Our blend is
    unique and crafted to perfection for
    its authentic taste. Our customers
    will feel delighted and would want to
    come back for more because there is
    nothing a cup of tea cannot solve!</p>

  <h2><strong>Royalty @3%</strong></h2>
  <p>We are charging a royalty of 3% on the products
    that you buy from us. Let us say, if you buy 10
    kgs of Tea Powder from us which is worth of
    Rs. 3500, we will add 3% to the 3500/- and
    you pay 3605/-. Likewise, for every product
    that you buy from us, a royalty @3% will be
    added to the bill. Be assured that we will not
    ask any royalty on the gross sales that a unit
    makes.</p>
